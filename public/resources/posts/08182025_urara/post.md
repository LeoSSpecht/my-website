## The experience

This is a small cozy place, with maybe 15-16 tables. We got in and were seated at the bar. The chef initially was quiet, but after we started asking some questions he turned out to be super friendly, we found out he is actually from Japan, and we had an interesting conversation about where he got his knifes (in portland).
Even if a little shy in the beginning, he explains what is each fish, and prepares it with mastery and care.

## The food

The fish was fresh, the rice was very good. For individual pieces the rice was warm, which shows it is an actual good sushi place. For the nigiri, as they all come at once and take a few minutes to prepare, the rice was not as warm.

The nigiri included a variety of fish, which I liked a lot, most of them had some kind of topping like uni, ikura, sauce, scallions, etc.

The sashimi samples were great to try different fishes, super fresh, flavourful and great textures.

As a point of improvement I would suggest maybe the chef adding some good soy sauce to some of the pieces, making the omakase experience even better. Maybe some flaky salt could be good on some of them!

As a bad point, the wasabi was still fake. For the price though, it was not expected to have the real one. As a recommendation, I would not get any rolls. I don’t think they would be bad, but I think the chirashi (fish over rice) brings so much more value to the experience, and for a fair price.
