A great omakase, with very welcoming chefs, fresh fish, and different well thought out flavors.

It has a blend of tradition with innovation, with some pieces being topped with chimichurri, and some pieces simply with soy sauce and wasabi, making the fish shine.
The real wasabi is definitely a major win, and you can feel it. It is strong and bold, but not lasting, you taste it and then it is gone, bringing the perfect bitterness to the different flavors.

The only reason it is not a 10 was the rice. It was definitely great rice, I could feel grain by grain, with the perfect texture, but it was missing flavor and seasoning for my palate, it could be bolder and deeper.

## The experience (Spoiler about the experience)
This was an interesting place, there aren't any big lights, signs or anything that shows that this is a restaurant. There is a door, a doorbell and a very small sign with _"Sushi"_ written on it.

After a few minutes of waiting the doors were opened and we were greeted into a small bar. Initially I thought, this is really not what I was expecting. The bar looked kind of old, small and without much decoration; very underwhelming.

To my surprise, after being served 3 starters you are directed into the actual sushi bar, with cozy lights, very good decorations, comfortable chairs, settling in for a great experience.

The chefs present themselves, and the experience begins. You are served 16 pieces of sushi, and a dessert. The whole experience took about 2h.

## Appetizers
1. Nori Tempura with Bluefin tail
    - Nori tempura
    - Bluefin tail tartar
    - Wasabi
    - Tomato purée
    - Marinated ikura

    This was a great starter. The ikura was fresh and welcoming. The tuna was not as prevalent and not the star, but the blend of flavors was very welcome.

2. Canadian Prawn
    - Canadian prawn
    - Tofu sauce
    - Prawn head reduction

    The prawn was good, but I was surprised by the tofu sauce, it has a completely unexpected texture and flavor. It brought memories of wet paper as I tried it, it does not sound good, but it was very pleasant, velvety and smooth.

3. Purin
    - Purin
    - Wagyu bits

    A classic egg pudding with bits of wagyu and scallops.
    Honestly it tasted like a classic egg and bacon American breakfast, the wagyu bits were small so hard to differentiate between any other fried meat. The texture was very smooth and soothing.

4. Cocktail (complementary)

    Lime juice, Japanese whisky, sake and ginger syrup.
    The cocktail was strong, with a very bold ginger flavor, without being overwhelming. There was some sweetness to it, but just enough to balance it out. My friend liked it so much he ordered 2 more.

## Omakase

1. Hamachi

    _Served with cornbread pudding and wasabi._

    One of my favorite fish in general, but not the best of the night.
    The cornbread pudding gave a different texture and flavor; something I did not think would go together, but was not a bad combination.

2. Hotate

    _Served torched with miso reduction._

    A very soft and flavorful scallop. A king scallop.
    A lot more buttery and soft than most scallops.
    The torch always gives a nice taste and scent while enjoying it.

3. Madai (4th)
    
    _Served with crispy chili flakes and scallions_

    This was a welcome surprise. I was expecting something super spicy and strong, which would masquerade the fish.

    To my surprise it was actually very aromatic and soft on the mouth, as if it was coating your mouth, without overflowing anything.

    The fish was very good.


4. Kampachi (2nd best) 

    _Smoked, served with orange and black salt_

    This one was a journey on the mouth. You could feel every different flavor and taste, one at a time, as if everything was planned. 

    First came the smokiness, which is not very common with fish. Then the bitterness of the orange. And lastly the sweetness of the fish completing the journey. Full of deep and curated flavor. A masterpiece.


5. Aori Ika

    This was a type of squid that I had never tried before. As expected it is very firm, a little chewy, but very flavorful. According to the chef it was cut to the size of grain rice, to make it more palatable and easier to eat.

    Not the most comforting fish, but a great bite.

6. Tairagai

    _Served with pickled lemon and lime zest_

    This is a Japanese clam that I had not tried. It had a harder texture, similar to squid. A nice mouthfeel.

    Not bad, but not a must.

7. Shima Aji (1st)

    _Served with a Japanese style chimichurri, black lava salt and a citron kombu sauce_

    For me this was the best of the night. The fish had an amazing texture, it was fresh, light and sweet; while having a deep lingering flavor.

    The complements were a good addition, a bit of salt, a bit herby. I wondered how just the fish would taste, and what other flavors could have been there. Definitely would try again.

8. Ora King (Salmon)

    _Served with Japanese mustard, pickled fennel pepper and tsukudani nori_

    Ora King Salmon from New Zealand. The salmon was very high quality, and very fresh. We were served the salmon belly, so it was very fatty and buttery.

    But to my palate, it was missing flavor. It felt watery, as if the flavor had been diluted. I guess compared to the other complex, bold and deep flavors of the night it just didn't stand out.

9. Bincho Maguro (Albacore) (3rd)

    _Rubbed in garlic confit, wrapped in negori sake seaweed. Served with ponzu, fresh wasabi and crispy onion._

    This was a punch from start to finish. On first bite you can feel the punch of the garlic, with the crispy onion, the boldness of the sake seaweed that also gave a bit of an aged mouthfeel. Deep, elaborate and complex, but robust and classy.

10. Hirame (4th)

    _Served with yuzu soy sauce, a twist on a gochujang sauce and a chiffonade shiso_

    This was also a good mix of flavors. You could feel the shiso, bringing a herby earthy flavor. The sauce was not too spicy, but added complexity and boldness to the fish. A very good combination.

    The texture and freshness of the fish was also impressive.

11. Akami (5th)

    _Served with soy sauce, wasabi and salt_

    This is a classic well done. Topped with just the essentials to make the fish shine. Forget store-bought or average tuna, this is full of flavor, a power that can't be seen on regular tuna. It was not fatty, but it was still delicious.

12. Toro

    _Bluefin toro, lightly torched and served with flambéed pineapple, yuzu soy and wasabi_

    Bluefin toro is always good, fatty, buttery, flavorful. As expected it was good.

    But, the pineapple made it too sweet in my opinion, instead of making the fish shine it made it childish in my opinion, hiding the complexity of the tuna.

13. A5 Wagyu

    _Served with egg yolk sauce, black sea salt, and wasabi._

    A generous piece of wagyu, more than enough to feel the fattiness and tenderness of the beef. Felt like the perfect mix of fatty meat with salty bites and a richness from the yolk.

14. Bone Marrow

    _Served with salt, soy and lemon juice_

    I was surprised at how they could extract an actual full piece of bone marrow without breaking it up.

    This was maybe more fatty than the wagyu, a little gelatinous from the collagen. The salt and lemon juice definitely helped to balance it.

    When I first tried it I immediately remembered a popcorn taste, maybe the buttery or fatty taste brought that to me. It was worth trying it, but being fatty was its best quality, as opposed to being deep or elaborate.

15. Anago (6th)

    _Roasted sea eel in Szechuan peppercorn and maple syrup, "deep fried" in the bone marrow with an array of sauces_

    Eel is another of my favorite fish, so I was very excited for this one. It was a different kind of eel, it was not too fatty and it did not come with the usual eel sauce which was a welcome change. The additional bone marrow added a lot to the flavor.

    The texture was also very interesting, it was almost sandy in a way, and it was very good, this was kind of unique so very hard to explain it.

16. Uni (7th)

    _Served in a handroll with soy sauce_

    This was the best uni I ever had. It was so sweet, buttery and flavorful. For me uni always reminds me of the sea, as if I was eating the sea. And this was the freshest piece of the sea I ever had.

    The chef also made a contrast of the cold uni with the warm rice, giving it a nice mouthfeel.

17. Dessert

    _Coconut sesame shortbread cookie, with a makrut (a kind of lime) ice cream covered in matcha white chocolate. Paired with a lavender, smoked honey, yuzu sake tea._

    This was one of the best desserts I ever had, and definitely the best I had from other omakases. It was fresh, light, but more importantly it was so floral. The combination of the hot tea with the cold ice cream was perfect. It was as if I was eating straight from a flower garden.
